## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please email ps4798214@gmail.com with a detailed description of the issue. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we've had a chance to address it.

We aim to respond to all reports within 48 hours and will keep you updated as we investigate and resolve the issue. 

If we accept the vulnerability report:
- We will work on a fix and keep you informed of our progress.
- We may ask for your input or clarification during this process.
- Once resolved, we will publicly disclose the issue and credit you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

If we decline the report:
- We will provide a clear explanation of our reasoning.
- If you disagree with our assessment, we're open to further discussion.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure!
